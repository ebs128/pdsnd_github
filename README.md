### Project Title
Bikeshare-2

### Description
This project is the analysis of bike sharing data from 3 cities; Chicago, New York City, and Washington.  The data was normalized to some degree to reflect common data available across all 3 cities.

  Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

  most common day of week
  most common hour of day

  Popular stations and trip
  most common start station
  most common end station
  most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

  Trip duration
  total travel time
  average travel time

  User info
  counts of each user type
  counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
  earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
